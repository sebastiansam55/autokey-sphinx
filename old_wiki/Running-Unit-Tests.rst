Running the unit tests
======================

The unit test suite has two additional requirements:

-  `Pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest>`__ -
   `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/pytest/>`__
-  `PyHamcrest <https://github.com/hamcrest/PyHamcrest/>`__ -
   `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/PyHamcrest/>`__

Running the test suite is integrated into ``setup.py``. The tests can be
run by executing ``python3 setup.py test`` from the repository root
directory.
