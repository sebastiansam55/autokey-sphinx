  <p>This page contains a basic introduction on what AutoKey is and what it
does.</p>
<div class="section" id="glossary-of-autokey-terms">
<h1>Glossary of AutoKey Terms<a class="headerlink" href="#glossary-of-autokey-terms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We are including the glossary of AutoKey terms at the beginning of the
users manual because understanding our definitions of the terms, as they
apply to AutoKey, will make understanding the AutoKey much easier.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>abbreviation</strong> is a short sequence of letters, numbers or symbols
that when typed will trigger AutoKey to do something (run a script,
insert a phrase, display a menu).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AutoKey icon</strong> - the letter “A” icon that appears in the
notification area or system tray when AutoKey is started. Clicking on
the icon opens a pop-up menu that gives you access to AutoKey’s
features. The icon can be changed–either by an icon theme or in the
preferences menu.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>folders</strong> are displayed in the left column of the main window. They
can contain sub-folders, scripts and phrases. You can add sub-folders
or create new folders as needed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>hotkey</strong> - a key or combination of keys that, when pressed, will
trigger AutoKey to do something; run a script, insert a phrase or
display a menu. A hotkey can be created using any key on the keyboard
(within reason), with or without one or more modifier keys. The
modifier keys are Shift, Control, Alt and Super (a.k.a. Windows).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>phrase</strong> - a text string or block of text. Phrases can include one
or more scripts and their output can add content to the text (ex:
current time) or modify it in other ways (ex: position, format,
footnotes, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>script</strong> - a small program written in Python. It can start other
programs, send commands to a running window, re-size your window,
reposition your cursor after execution, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>tray menu</strong> - pop-up menu that appears when the AutoKey icon is
clicked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>triggers</strong> - hotkeys and typed abbreviations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>macro</strong> - A special <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;tag&gt;</span></code> that can be placed inside a phrase,
turning the phrase into a dynamic phrase. Upon phrase expansion, the
tags are replaced with text. For example, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">date</span></code> tag is
replaced with the current date and time. For details, see <a class="reference external" href="../wiki/Dynamic-Phrases,-Using-Macros-as-placeholders-in-Phrases">Dynamic
Phrases, Using Macros as placeholders in
Phrases</a></p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="how-are-things-organized">
<h1>How are things organized?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-are-things-organized" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Each AutoKey phrase and script consists of two files, a file containing
the body of the script or phrase and a sidecar file containing the
metadata for the script or phrase. You have to make sure you copy/move
the pairs together or they will not work.</p>
<p>Scripts: my_script.py / .my_script.json</p>
<p>Phrases: my_phrase.txt / .my_phrase.json</p>
<p>Because the metadata file names start with a dot, they are hidden files
by default and some copy commands like cp will miss them by default.
rsync will get them. (Credits to Joe)</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-source-settings-on-a-new-computer">
<h2>How to “source” settings on a new computer?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-source-settings-on-a-new-computer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, install (latest) AutoKey on the new computer and press the New
icon, then Folder. Select the folder that contains the settings from the
previous installation. Expect to see an empty folder from the panel on
the left.</p>
<p>Secondly, quit the current AutoKey session through its icon in the
system tray, and start AutoKey again. Since AutoKey does not monitor its
“directories” on the fly, restarting it necessary.</p>

<h1>Why Would You Use AutoKey And What Does It Do For You?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-would-you-use-autokey-and-what-does-it-do-for-you" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>AutoKey can be a huge time saver, energy saver and productivity booster
and can also reduce the stress on your arms and hands.</p>
<div class="section" id="some-examples">
<h2>Some examples:<a class="headerlink" href="#some-examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are certain things you type over and over; your address, your
company name or your custom signature. AutoKey’s abbreviations can
automatically expand a few characters into any of your commonly used
text blocks. For programmers, AutoKey’s text insertion features can let
you easily insert code tags, dividers, etc. at the cursor position.</p>
<p>If you use database, CAD/CAM, engineering or scientific software that
require complex key combinations, AutoKey can be configured to send
commands that will activate those features with a single keystroke.</p>
<p>Instead of just inserting text, a script can be used to manipulate
several different running programs, transfer text between them, start
and close them as well as send keyboard and mouse input to them.</p>
<p>AutoKey works across all applications. Any phrase, script or
abbreviation can be used in multiple applications. This means you do not
have to configure all the different applications that you use–you can do
it once in AutoKey and it works for all your applications.</p>
<p>AutoKey is very useful if you write or edit business documents, novels,
documentation, articles, web blogs, programs or fill out a lot of forms.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-autokey-and-how-does-it-work">
<h1>What Is AutoKey and How Does It Work?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-autokey-and-how-does-it-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>It is a trigger or selection activated, automation utility program for
Linux and X11. When a trigger is detected by Autokey, one of three
things can happen; a script is activated, text is inserted at the cursor
position or a pop-up menu is displayed allowing a script or phrase to be
activated by selecting it.</p>
<p>AutoKey scripts can literally do almost anything that can be coded as a
Python program. Python scripts are user created and can be shared
between users. AutoKey includes a range of sample Python scripts, and
there are countless Python scripting resources on-line for learning how
to write scripts.</p>
<p>The core part of AutoKey works by sending and receiving keyboard events
via the X server. It supports multiple ways of communicating with X and
as such should –in theory– work with any Western keyboard layout.
(Problems are known to exist with Russian/Mandarin/Japanese languages)</p>

<div class="section" id="adding-abbreviations">
<h1>Adding Abbreviations<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-abbreviations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>On the left side of the configuration window you will see a “tree” view
of the folders/subfolders already in AutoKey.</p>
<p>Let’s first add a New Top-level folder for the abbreviations you are
going to add:</p>
<p>File &gt; Create &gt; New Top-level Folder. You can choose to create the new
folder anywhere you wish, or you may click “Use Default” and type a
name. This will create a new folder under the default folder.</p>
<p>Now that we have a new folder, we can start adding abbreviations.</p>
<p>Ensure you have the folder you want the phrase created in selected, then
press Ctrl + N or use the menu or the right-click menu. The main menu
option is File &gt; Create &gt; New Phrase. Enter a name for your phrase and
click OK.</p>
<p>Next press the tab key to get to the big dialog window to enter the
contents of your phrase. Once the phrase is entered press Ctrl + Tab to
navigate via keyboard or click on the “Set” button for “Abbreviation”.
This will bring up a “Set Abbreviation” dialog - this is where you set
the actual abbreviation for the phrase. Leave the “Trigger on” to
“Default.” Make sure you leave “Remove typed abbreviation” checked,
unless you want to leave the abbreviation in the document for some
reason.</p>
<p>In this example, we’ll set the “Match phrase case to typed abbreviation”
- this option and “Ignore case of typed abbreviation” work in concert to
let your abbreviation expand with case sensitivity:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 52%" />
<col style="width: 48%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Abbreviation</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>You See</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>tp</p></td>
<td><p>the patient</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Tp</p></td>
<td><p>The patient</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>TP</p></td>
<td><p>THE PATIENT</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Click “OK” or type Alt to accept the abbreviation settings. One last
step - click “Save” or Control + S to save the changes to the phrase.</p>
<p>Now, if you type the abbreviation you created in any document or window,
it will be replaced with the phrase contents you created.</p>
